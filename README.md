This is Old Library, I am planning to revamp it.

In the repository it is not only the library project but also the example project "sample_client"; 
thanks to it you will learn how to use the library.

*There are different ways of adding this library to your code*

### Gradle / Maven dependency

dependencies {
    ...
    implementation 'com.leonardpark.pixel:1.0.1'
    ...
}
```

### As a git submodule
Basically get this code and compile it having it integrated via a git submodule:

1. go into your own apps directory on the command line and add this lib as a submodule: ```git submodule add https://github.com/leokwsw/pixel-image.git pixel-image```
